The SessionProvider is used to manage the state of your application, specifically the session data that needs to persist across multiple pages and request-response cycles. This can include things like user authentication status, preferences, or any other data that needs to be shared across different parts of your application.

In a Next.js app, when you navigate to a new page, the entire page is reloaded, and all its JavaScript is executed from scratch. This means that if you have some state that you want to persist between pages, you need to save it somewhere that can survive this reload. The SessionProvider provides a convenient way to manage this state by using the useSession hook.

You can use the useSession hook to read and update values in the session, and the SessionProvider makes sure that the session data is stored in a way that is consistent across pages and requests. The SessionProvider uses either a cookie or local storage (depending on your configuration) to store the session data. When a user navigates to a new page, the session data is sent to the server along with the request, and the server can access this data to customize the response.
